Mafatih al-Jinan
## Dua Kumayl
O Allah, I ask You by Your mercy, which embraces all things;
And by Your strength, through which You dominate all things,
And toward which all things are humble
And before which all things are lowly;
## Dua Tawbah
O Allah, I repent to You from my sins.
Accept my repentance and wash away my sins.
