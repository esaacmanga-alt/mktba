Nahj al-Balagha
## Sermon 1
Praise is due to Allah whose worth cannot be described by speakers, whose bounties cannot be counted by calculators and whose claim (to obedience) cannot be satisfied by those who attempt to do so, whom the height of intellectual courage cannot appreciate, and the divings of understanding cannot reach; He for whose description no limit has been laid down, no eulogy exists, no time is ordained and no duration is fixed. He brought forth creation through His Omnipotence, dispersed winds through His Compassion, and made firm the shaking earth with rocks.
## Sermon 2
I praise Him seeking completion of His Blessing, submitting to His Glory and expecting safety from His sin. I invoke His help being in need of His Sufficiency (protection). He whom He guides does not go astray, He to whom He is hostile gets no protection. He whom He supports does not remain in need. Praise is most weighty of all that is weighed and the most valuable of all that is treasured.
