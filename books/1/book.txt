The Holy Quran
## Introduction
This is the holy book of Islam.
## Chapter 1
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
The Beneficent, the Merciful.
Master of the Day of Judgment.
Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help.
Show us the straight path.
The path of those whom Thou hast favored; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.
